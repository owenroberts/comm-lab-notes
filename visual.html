		<div class="slide">
			<h1>Content vs. Medium</h1>
		</div>

		<div class="slide">
			<p>In Comm Lab we're often more interested in students developing their technical abilities than the content of their work.  We care about the content, but it's often not the focus of our assessment.</p>
			<p>Digital Expressions projects focus on content.</p>
			<p>Adding visual, audio or other multi media content should complement the content of the project.</p>
			<p>What kinds of structural and stylistic aspects of a project can be achieved more effectively in one medium or another?</p>
		</div>

		</div>
		<div class="slide">
			<p>In this case, Zeno's Paradox is efficiently demonstrated through the animation.  Because the concept deals in spatial terms, it is easier to describe and understand visually, and even more so using motion graphics.</p>
			<p>Most of the content is verbal, there is a voice over and text on the screen.</p>

		<div class="slide">
			<p>In visual media, meaning is created through the interaction of images.</p>
			<p>The Kuleshov Effect is an argument with a beginning, middle and end.  Although the order of the scenes could be rearraged, you need all three of them to complete the argument.</p>
			<p>Although the film can be read in many ways, the structure is simple and clear.</p>

			<h2>Assignment</h2>
			<p>Medium</p>
			<li>Our assignments are medium specific, so the question is: Does student's content make sense with the medium?</li>
			<li>DE assignments are content specific, so question is: Does the medium make sense for the content?</li>
			<li>IMA more concerned with technical profienciecy, DE grade more on content.</li>
			<p>Group vs. Individual</p>
			<li>Evaluating student contributions to group projects</li>
			<p>Documentation</p>
			<li>Helps demonstrate the extent of the students work</li>

		<div class="slide">
			<h2>Evaluating - What to look for?</h2>
			<p>Transitions</p>
			<li>Follow from one shot to the next? (Like sentence to sentence flow)</li>
			<li>Style of editing consistent over time? (Like voice)</li>
			<p>Structure</p>
			<li>Beginning, middle and end?</li>
