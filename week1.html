			<p>In this foundation course, designed to provide students with a framework to effectively communicate through digital means, students will explore the possibilities of digital media by successively producing projects that make use of digital images, audio, video, and the Web. Students learn in a laboratory context of hands-on experimentation, and principles of interpersonal communications, media theory, and human factors will be introduced in readings and investigated through discussion. Adobe Creative Cloud and other relevant software applications will be examined, and the basics of fundamental web languages HTML and CSS will be studied, to establish a diverse digital toolkit. Both traditional and experimental outputs, including online and interactive media platforms, will be explored. Weekly assignments, group, and independent projects, as well as project reports will be assigned in each of the core areas of study. </p>

			<h1>WordPress</h1>
		</div>
		<div class="slide">
			<p>All assignments for communications lab will be submitted on the WordPress documentation blog:</p>
			<p><a href="http://ima.nyu.sh/documentation/category/communications-lab/" target="blank">http://ima.nyu.sh/documentation/category/communications-lab/</a></p>
			<p>Some of you will already have a login for WordPress. If you do not have one, you will receive a new login sometime before next class.  Once your receive the username and password you will have 24 hours to login before it expires, so do it right away.  You can then change your password if you want to.</p>
			<p>To log in, go to this page and use your student ID and password:</p>
			<p><a href="http://ima.nyu.sh/documentation/wp-login.php" target="blank">http://ima.nyu.sh/documentation/wp-login.php</a></p>

		<div class="slide">
			<p>When posting to the documentation blog, clearly label your post with the assignment in the title. <br>For example:</p>
			<p>Assignment 1: Response to Walter Benjamin</p>
			<p>You must also use the category "Communications Lab".  If your post is not categorized correctly I may not be able to find it.</p>

			<h1>File Management</h1>
		</div>
		<div class="slide">
			<p>File management is very important in Communications Lab, as well as other classes in IMA, and for any multimedia project that requires the organization of code, documents and media assets.</p>
			<p>File management is particularly important for web development.  In order for websites to behave properly, your files must be named correctly and be in the location that you think they are in.  This may seem easy and simple, but it is one of the main causes for a website not functioning correctly.</p>
			<p>Throughout the semester, I will be demonstrating good ways to organize and name your files.  Please be careful to follow my instructions, or, if something is confusing, ask me to clarify.  This will save everyone from big headaches in the future.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="slide">
			<img src="week1/files.png" />
		</div>
		<div class="slide">
			<p>Some basic conventions for website directories and documents:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Lower case and upper case letters are not the same, ie: "Index.html" and "index.html" will look for two different documents.</li>
				<li>Avoid white space.  That means no spaces, like "My Website", or tabs.  People often use dashes instead, "my-website", or underscores, "my_website".</li>
				<li>Be consistent.  If you use upper case letters in some folder, use them in all folders.  Same for lower case.  Generally, I prefer to only use lower case.  For example, if you main folder is "my-website", your sub folders could be "my-videos", "my-photos" etc.  If your main folder is "my_website" your sub folders should be "my_videos" and "my_photos".</li>
				<li>Shorter names are generally better, as long as you don't sacrifice specificity, ie: "web" is probably better than "owen-roberts-website", unless there are multiple users.</li>
				<li>Don't move your files into different folders unless you are absolutely sure what you are doing.  Don't rename folder or files unless you are sure what you're doing.  If you change the name of a folder or file, it will not update other files that reference it, so be very careful.  I see a lot of mistakes where students changed a file name and then a project stopped working.</li>

			<h1>Text Editor</h1>
		</div>
		<div class="slide">
			<img src="week1/sublime-text-logo.png" />
		</div>
		<div class="slide">
			<p>We will be using a text editor throughout the semester to write HTML, CSS and JavaScript documents.</p>
			<p>The preferred text editor for this class is Sublime Text 2 or 3.</p>
			<p>Download: <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/3" target="blank">http://www.sublimetext.com/3</a></p>
			<p>There are many features of Sublime Text 3 which make it optimal for creating and editing web pages and I will demonstrate various features throughout the semester.</p>
			<p>It is available of Mac and PC and free to use (although there is a suggested donation).</p>
			<p>There are other text editors that are perfectly acceptable such and Vim, TextMate and TextEdit, however, I will demonstrate new lessons in Sublime Text, so it will be easiest to follow along in the same program.</p>
			<p>Do not use Dreamweaver, Muse, Edge, or other programs that generate HTML in this class.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="slide">
			<h2>Cyberduck</h2>
			<p>We will use Cyberduck to upload our files to our shared server.</p>
			<p>Download: <a href="https://cyberduck.io/?l=en" target="blank">https://cyberduck.io/?l=en</a></p>
			<p>Once you have installed Cyberduck, download this file and double click it in your Downloads folder.  It will create a new connection in Cyberduck.  We are all sharing the same account this semester, so I will share the password in class.  Please write it down but do not spread it outside of class.</p>
			<p><a href="http://comlab.nyu.sh/uploads/week1/archive.zip" target="blank">Cyberduck Info</a></p>
			<p>After you enter the password and hit Connect, you will most likely see a dialog warning that says "Unsecured Connection".  If you are on campus, you are on a secure connection and should choose "Continue".  Otherwise you will not be able to login.  Once you click Continue, click continue on the next dialog box and you will log on.</p>
			<p>Once you log onto Cyberduck you will see a directory structure very similar to what you see in the Mac's Finder.  There are two folders for the two sections of Comm Lab.  The 11:15 - 12:30 section will use the 13214 folder and the 3:15 - 4:30 section will use the 19070 folder.</p>
			<p>Please create a folder with your preferred name before class on Thursday.  For example, my folder would be "owenroberts".</p>
			<p>Web assignments will be uploaded to this server.  Your personal folder should look silimar or identical to your local folders and files on your computer for your web assignments.</p>
